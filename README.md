Customer churn prediction and segmentation using product usage data

# Customer Churn Prediction & Product Analytics

## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based products.
Understanding which users are likely to churn and why enables targeted
retention strategies and improved product decisions.

This project focuses on building a churn prediction pipeline using
customer behavior and usage features.
