# Customer Churn Prediction & Product Analytics

## Problem Statement
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription-based products.
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using behavioral,
demographic, and usage features to support data-driven retention strategies.

---

## Objective
- Explore customer usage and engagement patterns
- Identify key churn drivers
- Build classification models to predict churn risk
- Compare interpretable and tree-based approaches

---

## Dataset
- Telco Customer Churn Dataset (public)
- Contains customer demographics, service usage, billing information,
  and churn labels.

---

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature encoding and scaling
3. Train–test split with stratification
4. Baseline modeling using Logistic Regression
5. Advanced modeling using Random Forest
6. Model evaluation using classification metrics and ROC-AUC
7. Model comparison and interpretation

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

---

## Evaluation Metrics
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- ROC-AUC

---

## Results Summary
- Logistic Regression provides a strong interpretable baseline.
- Random Forest improves predictive performance by capturing non-linear
  relationships between features.
- The project demonstrates trade-offs between interpretability and accuracy
  in churn prediction problems.
